## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- pseudo element : hover for buttons
- picture tag to pull in image sources based on device width

### What I learned

Things I did differently on this challenge:

- put basic styles (e.g. margin, color) for various elements in the element rather than styles.css file...curious if this good practice? Ended up pulling most of these out as became a pain as I added media queries.
- used flexbox for centering images and text
- used picture elements to load certain images based on device...thinking this should be based on viewport rather than device?

### Continued development

Struggled with amount of time to get this done as had to re-work as I added media queries. I'm thinking I need to come with a method so started looking into CUBE. Need to look at others as well.

Overthought a couple of image placement issues but forced me to learn image placement techniques.

### Useful resources

Tend to use LinkedIn Learning for learning new techniques. And W3 schools is quite good.
